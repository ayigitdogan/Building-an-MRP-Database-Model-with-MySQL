# MRP Database Model with MySQL

In this project, on which I have been working as my term project for Enterprise Information Systems class at Boğaziçi University, I created a database with MySQL to automate the calculations of "Material Resources Planning (MRP) Algorithm".

## Environment

I used MySQL in Visual Studio Code, along with the extension MySQL to write the SQL parts. To avoid spending time with converting SQL codes to strings to run them inside the program, I have chosen R as the programming language since the R Markdown format provides a special type of code chunk to directly run SQL queries. Also, it provides easy solutions to export query results in clean tables. The program can be found in the folder as “project_mrp.rmd”.
